These files are related to my submission to the [DengAI: Predicting Disease Spread competition](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/44/dengai-predicting-disease-spread/) hosted on driven data.

The competition calls for predicting the number of dengue cases in two cities (San Juan Puerto Rico and Iquitos Peru), given environmental data. Prediction was achieved by employing a neural network.
A comprehensive write-up of my analysis can be found [here](https://github.com/pgjauregui/Predictive-Analytics/blob/main/DengAI_Predicting_Disease_Spread_(Neural_Network_Forecasting)/DengAI%20Write%20Up.pdf) (within this folder).
